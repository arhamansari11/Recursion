# Recursion in Programming

Recursion is a fundamental concept in programming where a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. This README file will walk you through the basics of recursion, some common patterns, and examples.

## What is Recursion?
Recursion occurs when a function calls itself to solve a problem. It allows us to write elegant solutions for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems.

### Example of Recursion:
```python
def recursion_example(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return
    print(n)
    recursion_example(n-1)
```


## When to Use Recursion?

Recursion is ideal for problems that:
- Can be divided into similar subproblems.
- Have a natural recursive structure, like tree traversals, divide-and-conquer algorithms, and mathematical computations like factorial and Fibonacci series.
